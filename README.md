# Design patterns
well-proved solution for solving the specific problems

### Creational Pattern
1. Factory Pattern - most used pattern. In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic 
2. Singleton Pattern - involves a single class 
3. Builder Pattern - builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach.	
4. Prototype pattern - refers to creating duplicate object while keeping performance in mind.	

### Structural Pattern
1. Adapter Pattern - Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.	
2. Bridge Pattern - Bridge is used when we need to decouple an abstraction from its implementation 
4. Composite pattern - is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. 	
5. Decorator (composition)Pattern - add new functionality to an existing object 
6. Facade Pattern - hides the complexities of the system 
7. Flyweight Pattern - reduce the number of objects created and to decrease memory footprint 

### Behavioral Pattern
1. Iterator Pattern - This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without any need to know its underlying
2. Observer Pattern - Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects 
3. Command Pattern
